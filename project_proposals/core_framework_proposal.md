# Core Framework Proposal - 7ETH Core

## What is the problem

Redundancy, inefficiency, non-compliance, and other related issues.   Developing solutions and applications across similar technology stacks and vertical 'silos' increases the risk of wasted efforts and non-standardized approaches. 


## What is the solution

A core framework that supports the initiatives and ideas that 7ETH pursues.   Common functionality and technical implementations required across projects can be consilidated here to support reuse, collaboration, standardization, etc.  This framework would be implemented in parallel and in support of the other projects being worked on.


## Tech stack

Any technology required to support the intiatives of 7ETH.

Examples include, but not limited to:
- Ethereum 
- dApp
- Solidity
- Truffle
- React
- Node
- Angular
- IPFS
- MetaMask
- uPort
- ...


## Time/Difficulty estimate

This would be an ongoing effort to support 7ETH initiatives.
