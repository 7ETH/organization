# Registry System Proposal - 7ETH Registrar

## What is the problem

Poof of Ownership, Systems Integration, and Information Dissemination.   Centralized registry systems provide a single point of failure to legal title of anything that can be owned.   Centralized registry systems are restrictive in how they disseminate information, and  do not inherently interface well with other systems that require their information.


## What is the solution

 A block chain based registry system that can support multiple products and verticals. A base system that can be expanded to support land ownership, vehicles, possessions of value, etc.  It can be used to provide Proof Of Ownership, data validation, information sharing, and systems integration with other systems such as licensing, insurance, legal, etcâ€¦.
