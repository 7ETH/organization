# 7ETH Organization Repository

Hello! This repository keeps track and stores all the necessary documentation for 7ETH. Docs, resources, how-tos... Anything that can come in handy for this little initiative of ours!

### Introduction to 7ETH
It all started with an Ethereum course that we took. Some of us were not working on a blockchain-related job, and we were concerned about getting blockchain experience: that is how this started! 7ETH (for now) is an open-source initiative which anybody can join (also for now). In Python, the story would be something like this:
```python
if self.job not in ["blockchain", "ethereum", "dapp development"]:
	work_with_others(
		reason = "I want to learn",
		values = ["collaboration", "support from others", "exposure"],
		organization = "https://github.com/7ETH",
		worth = True
	)
```

### Mission
7ETH is an open source community of developers that help each other, collaborate and work on blockchain projects under the organization in order to gain experience and exposure to the blockchain world

### Vision
What is the future of 7ETH? Interesting question... Should we turn this into a startup? Like a blockchain consulting firm?
As of new, we are just having fun :)

### Communication
As of now, we have a [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/7eth/shared_invite/enQtNDU4MDE1NTExMDcyLTg4OTIxOGM5MzQ0ODY5YWFiNmQ2NTRkNzgyNDU3NjBkZDVjNDI3OTg0NTM4Y2FhZDg2ZDk3ZGI0NDBiNzE3OGQ) that anybody can join!
We also communicate through GitHub issues. To join our organization, just shoot as a message on Slack.

### New project proposals
We decided to organize how we introduce new projects into the company. Anybody is free to work in whatever they want, but it is recommended to follow [these guidelines](proposal_guidelines.md) in order to bring developers to work with you on your idea or just to clearly tell the world what your project is about.
